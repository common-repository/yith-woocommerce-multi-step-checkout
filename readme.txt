Make your checkout page fluid with YITH WooCommerce Multi-step Checkout, a plugin that helps make checkout faster, tidier and more user-frienldy

== Description ==

**New 2020 update! Version 2.0 available!**

**[Free live demo >](https://plugins.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-multi-step-checkout-free/)**

A/B split testing on checkout pages (analysis made to find out which checkout structure works better on e-commerce sites) has shown that a multi-step layout is the best option for a better user experience during the purchase process.

The plugin YITH WooCommerce Multi-step Checkout helps to sort data and split the checkout process into different sections displayed one after the other: this makes it much clearer from the customer’s point of view and reduces the checkout abandonment rate.
